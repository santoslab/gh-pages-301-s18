.. _polling:

Polling
#######

CS 301 is a large class, and it is often difficult to achieve levels instructor/student interaction that are
necessary for successful learning and feedback.

In CS 301, we will use a `Classroom Response System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response>`__ to:

* facilitate learning by asking students to recall information (the mental act of recalling
  helps "wire" knowledge into brain so that you can remember it better later)

* help your instructor know when students are understanding a concept or when further review/explanation is needed

* increase engagement and interaction in the classroom.

We will use the Reef Education classroom response system.   To use Reef in class, you can use your laptop (you login
in your web-based reef account and interact through a web app) or you can use a mobile app for your phone or tablet.
You also have the option of using a iClicker remote.   We recommend using with the web or mobile Reef app because it
provides more interaction and feedback.

To get set up for in-class polling, you need to do the following things:

* register/pay for a Reef education account,

* decide which app/remote you want to use,

* associate your Reef account with the Reef CS 301 course, and

* associate your Canvas account with your Reef account.

carrying out the steps above.

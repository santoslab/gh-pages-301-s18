<h2>Objective and Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#objective-and-topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first notions of formal logic were invented over 2000 years ago as philosophers
attempted to develop systematic approaches for arriving at statements that were true.
By the time we approach adulthood, we will have heard many people say (or we will have said ourselves):
&#8220;that seems logical&#8221;, or &#8220;you&#8217;re being illogical&#8221;. By this, we understand that (in the first case)
sound reasoning principles have been used, whereas in the latter case someone may be stating a conclusion
that cannot be justified by sound reasoning from an initial set of true facts.
This &#8220;every day&#8221; notion of logic that manifests itself in the arguments that we make in
natural language is sometimes referred to as informal logic.</p>
<p>In contrast, in this course, we will study concepts related formal logics.
In simple terms, a formal logic consists of some syntax for stating claims (properties that are either true
or false) about the world (or some other more specialized domain in which we are interested)
and rules for deriving claims that are guaranteed true.</p>
<p>Formal logic is deeply tied to computer science, because computers are great at
&#8220;blindly following rules&#8221;, and many of the issues in which we are interested in
computer science can be phrased as basic claims and systems of rules.
The basic gates and circuits from which computers are built, the behavior of our programs
as they execute, the protocols that our computer systems used to communicate,
the expert systems that provide automated assistance to doctors, pilots, etc.
all can have their behaviors defined or explained using formal logics.
This is extremely important because it provides the basis for automated ruled-based reasoning for these systems.</p>
<p>In this course, we will learn the basic elements found in a formal logic including syntax for claims and rules
for making deductions. We will also learn how to judge if our rules are suitable in the
sense that they only lead us to claims that match the reality of the domain we are reasoning about.</p>
<p>Our focus will be on formal logics for reasoning about program behavior and for programming directly
in terms of logic. We will see how tools based on logic are used to reason about safety and
security critical software, network security, and security protocols.</p>

<div class="section" id="homeworks">
<h2>Homeworks<a class="headerlink" href="#homeworks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Homeworks are due almost every week and are to be submitted through
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ksu-cis-301">GitHub</a>.
Each student will be given a private repository that can be used to commit
homework assignments.
Assignments that are late will not be graded (based the git log),
unless in case of documented medical or family emergencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exams">
<h2>Exams<a class="headerlink" href="#exams" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Exams will be closed-book and closed notes.
The final will be comprehensive, but with emphasis on the latter part of the
course.</p>

<div class="section" id="grievances">
<h2>Grievances<a class="headerlink" href="#grievances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you think the instructor or the TAs have made an error when grading your test
or your homework, you are of course very welcome to ask for clarification.
But complaints about judgment calls, like how much credit to give for
a partially correct solution, are not encouraged (it is like arguing balls and
strikes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attendance-policy">
<h2>Attendance Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, there will be NO make-up exams (and homework)!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Emergencies: death in student&#8217;s immediate family, or
near-death experience of the student.</li>
<li>Non-emergencies: certified excused absences for official university activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the exam or exercise to be missed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statement-regarding-academic-honesty">
<h2>Statement Regarding Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#statement-regarding-academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which
is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one&#8217;s work is
performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance.
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus,
and via distance learning.
The honor system website can be reach via the following URL:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ksu.edu/honor">http://www.ksu.edu/honor</a>.</p>
<p>A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
&#8220;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work.&#8221;
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor
Pledge violation.</p>

<h2>Other Administrative Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#other-administrative-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Incompletenes:</strong> An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior
arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to departmental policy in
which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion.</li>
<li><strong>Drop Policy:</strong> It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are
enrolled but decide not to complete the course &#8212; there are no &#8220;automatic&#8221;
drops due to nonattendance.
The University allows a retake of a course with removal of the prior grade,
at most once per course, for a maximum of five courses.</li>
<li><strong>Students with Disabilities:</strong> If you have any physical or learning
disability which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as
I have outlined in this syllabus or which will require academic
accommodations, please notify me the first two weeks of the course.</li>
<li><strong>Harrassment:</strong> One purpose of your education is to help you develop skills,
approaches, and abilities that are necessary for effective teamwork, and for
your success in your profession and as a citizen.
